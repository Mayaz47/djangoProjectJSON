As a Python programmer I mainly worked on Machinelearning and DataScience project. Although I had a bit of experience with Django web application development it was very limited. While working on this project I had to make myself familiar with MVC architecture and basic concepts of Django web development. I had to face some challenges during this project which includes rendering matplotlib and seaborn graphs on the frontend while keeping the webpage dynamic, rendering large dataset on webpage and overall working with new Django concepts. I was able to overcome these challenges with rigorous attempts. Hopefully I have completed all the tasks assigned to me.
